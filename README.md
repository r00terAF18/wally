# wally - The wallpaper downloader youâ€™ve been waiting for (yeah right ðŸ¤£)

## Why?

Because there has to be one built using C# and .Net 6.

## No, Seriously why though ðŸ˜•?

Because I, like many other linux users, like to rice my OS, and having a lot of wallpapers downloaded from different sites is usefull.

## For Devs:

The BaseClass is the heart of it all, it handles Folder, Files and downloading the actuall images, Class specific files just adjust the URLâ€™s and names for the BaseClass.
